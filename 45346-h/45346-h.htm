<span class="i0">What shall we do with our day? you ask&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A June day fair to the heart’s desire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie in the meadow, and lounge and bask<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over books and tobacco? Or do you aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conquer the summit that yesterday<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We marked for our own ere your visit end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shall we go riding, or fishing? Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the scent of the sea’s on the air, my friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall go to the head of the reedy lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there, in a brake by a fir-grove, find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two long canoes with arching deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sea-riders, strong for a day of wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh, what a song shall the bright wind sing us<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When clear of the shallows and clear of the sedge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the narrowing stream and the ebb-tide swing us<br /></span>
<span class="i2">’Twixt sea and mountain to Wicklow Bridge!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But here beware! for the ebb goes roaring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through half the arches, and half are dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stakes and stones are ready for goring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your Rob-Roy’s timbers as down you fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beyond the Bridge, in the deep sea-current,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the rope-maze crosses from quay to quay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll need your head and your arm I warrant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To fight the eddies and find your way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lifts your prow with the long pulsation<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<span class="i2">That tells how near us the glad seas are!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lifts the heart with the old elation,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To meet the surf at the harbour-bar!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The North wind marshals the ranks of ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And on they sweep with a strength serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tide-race ruffles the mighty motion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And curls the crests of the rollers green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breakers flash on the sand-bank yonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the cavern’d curve of the rock-walled bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is loud with clamour of hoarse sea-thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the wave recoils in a blast of spray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I know a cleft among grim rock-masses,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where if wind blow strong and the light come fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sea-cave roars and the spray-jet flashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A rainbow floats in the sunny air.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At the Head’s wild verge, where the tideways quicken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eddies hollow the smooth sea-caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Rob-Roys plunge as the breakers thicken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bury their decks in the rearing waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We round the Point in the surge and welter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of clashing billows and blinding foam&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mile on mile, in the cliff-wall’s shelter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In calm new seas to the South we roam.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O bays of Wicklow, and gorse-crown’d headlands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose scent blows far on the seaward breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft have I yearned in the tranquil midlands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For one brave shock of your lifting seas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft it may be in days hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall rise the thought of you, phantom-fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall steal the sound of the sea-waves’ laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On ears grown dull with time and care!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves, wash my spirit, and lonely places,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If well I loved you, and aught you knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark deep my heart with immortal traces<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of shining days when I dwelt with you!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wind, O wind of the Spring, thine old enchantment renewing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How at the shock of thy might wakens within me a cry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of what wonderful lands, never trodden by man, never told of,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lands where never a ship anchored or trafficker fared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comest thou, breathing like flame till the brown earth flames into blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quick’ning the sap of old woods swayed in thy stormy embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rousing in depths of the heart wild waves of an infinite longing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Longing for freedom and life, yearning for Springs that are dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely the far blue sea, foam-fleck’d with the speed of thy coming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Brighten’d in laughter abroad, sang at the feet of the isles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang in a tumult of joy as my soul sings trembling with passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trembling with passion and hope, wild with the spirit of Spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, what dreams re-arise, half pain half bliss to remember,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Hearing the storm of thy song blown from the height of the skies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Something remains upon earth to be done, to be dared, to be sought for,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Up with the anchor once more&mdash;out with the sails to the blast!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Out to the shock of the seas that encircle the Fortunate Islands,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Vision that burns in the blood, home of the Wind of the Spring.</i><br /></span>

closing fifteen years of his life in the monastery of St. Fechin at
Cong, Co. Mayo. His grave is still shown in that most beautiful
and pathetic of Irish ruins. Some accounts have it that his
remains were afterwards transferred to Clonmacnois by the
Shannon.</p>

</div>
<p class="intronote italic">From “The Persians” of Aeschylus</p>

<p>[Except for inscriptions, this contemporary narrative of the
Battle of Salamis is the earliest piece of written Greek history
extant. The splendour and force of the original make it one of
the greatest pieces of battle-narrative in the world, and defy
adequate rendering. But it is noticeable that not only is the
description ablaze with the passion of war, but the plan and
tactics of the fight, which was probably even a more decisive
event in world-history than that of Marathon, are given with a
map-like precision and clearness.</p>

<p>The narrative is placed in the mouth of a messenger sent by
Xerxes to his mother, Atossa, to tell her of the catastrophe.
I have followed the text of Paley.]</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Began? Some Power malign began it all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some God that hated Persia. First, there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Greek deserter from the Athenian host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Keep watch,” he said, “for at the dead of night<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Our benches shall be manned, our fleet dispersed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will escape you in the narrow seas.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Xerxes heard, O Queen, and never saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greek man’s guile, nor knew the Gods his foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all the captains of the fleet he sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This order: “When the sun his fiery beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath hidden from the earth, and night holds all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The empire of the air, then set your ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some ranged in threefold line to guard the friths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close up all the roaring waterways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some to patrol the Isle of Salamis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mark ye, should the Greeks escape their doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one unguarded outlet, ’tis decreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your heads shall fall for it.” So spake the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haughty, infatuate, knowing not the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dutifully they obeyed his word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supper was first prepared; each oarsman then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked to his tholepin and bound fast the oar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the sunlight faded from the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night came on, the rowers went on board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with them every well-trained fighting man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon from squadron unto squadron rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the vast lines the cheering of the fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As each one rowed to his appointed place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So all night long the captains made us cruise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither and thither, every ship we had;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the night was spent, yet never once<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The Greeks had tried our watch in secret flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the white steeds of the God of Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounted the sky, and light possessed the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from the Greeks a mighty chant was borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant, to our ears, and every cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sea-girt Salamis pealed back the strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear possessed us every one, O Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And staggering doubt; for not as if in flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose the great pæan then among the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as when brave men cheer themselves for fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the heart-kindling trumpet spake, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard the thunder of a thousand oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swung together at the steersman’s cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once the sounding furrows smote.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then soon full clear their charging line we saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The right wing leading, and the main array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little after; and ere long we heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such cries as these: “On, children of the Greek!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now for your fatherland, for freedom now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wife and child, and for your fathers’ homes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now for the temples of your fathers’ Gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day we fight for all!” So cried they still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor were we Persians dumb, but sent them back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting for shouting. Little time there was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To range our lines, until the brazen beaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crash’d in among us. First, a ship of Greece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading the onset, rent off all the prow<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From a Ph&oelig;nician. Each then sought a foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first we stemm’d the torrent of their charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon our multitudes in the narrow seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were thronged and hampered, nor could any now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear help to other&mdash;yea, and many a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend hurtled upon friend, or rent away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shearing prow her whole array of oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the Greeks around us fiercely charged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side at once; the lighter barques<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were soon o’erset; the very seas were hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strewn with wreck and slaughter; every strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jutting rock-ledge was with corpses piled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pressed in ruinous disordered flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that was left of Persia’s mighty fleet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they, like fishers when the tunnies swarm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within some narrow inlet, slew amain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With aught that hand could seize&mdash;with shivered oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragments of wreck, they stabb’d, they stunn’d, they clove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out beyond the channel shrieks and wails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And panic fear possessed the open sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods! could I speak, nor cease for ten full days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had not told how thick disasters came!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know this, that never since the world began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perished in one day such a host of men!<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_THREE_RINGS_A_FABLE" id="THE_THREE_RINGS_A_FABLE">THE THREE RINGS: A FABLE</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="intronote"><i>From Lessing’s “Nathan der Weise”</i><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>[Since Plato, no writer has understood better than Lessing
the dramatic conduct of a philosophic dialogue. The following
colloquy is a beautiful example of his art and of his thought.</p>

<p>Nathan is a Jew, famed for his wealth and for his wisdom,
living in Jerusalem at the time of the Third Crusade. In the
following scene he has just been summoned to the presence
of the Sultan Saladin. He supposes that a loan of money is
the Sultan’s object. Instead of this, he finds that it is his
reputed wisdom which has gained him the interview. Nathan
is a man who cannot have taken his beliefs in spiritual things
without examination; here, then, says Saladin, are three faiths
contending for mastery, the Jewish, the Christian, and the
Mahommedan. Each claims to be the true and only true religion.
The claim cannot be true of more than one of them. Which
of them, in his inmost soul, does Nathan hold to be justified?
That he may have time to collect his thoughts, Saladin leaves
the Jew alone for a while before he answers. Nathan, who does
not yet know Saladin, is at first very doubtful of the <i>bona fides</i>
of the Musalman prince in making this inquiry of him.]</p>

<span class="i0">In the grey morn of Time, there lived i’ the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man, who owned a ring of priceless worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gift of a well-loved hand. For stone it bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An opal, where a hundred lovely tints<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus did he order it: He left the Ring<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That he in turn should leave it to the son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dearliest loved; and so to the dearest ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the owner of the Ring, apart<br /></span>

<span class="i34">Now turn we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to our rings again.&mdash;I said, the sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made their complaints: each one before the Judge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made oath that from his father’s very hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had the Ring&mdash;and so in truth he had&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">After his father’s promise, long before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one day he should own the Ring and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its rights&mdash;and this no less was true. The father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each one averr’d, could ne’er have played him false.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than credit this&mdash;rather than nurse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against so loved a father, such a thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fain soever he had been to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but good of them, he must believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brothers guilty of foul treachery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But surely one day he would find a way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To unmask the villains&mdash;he would be avenged!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now, the Judge? I am intent to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thou wilt put into his mouth. Speak on!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap i6">Nathan</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On this wise spake the Judge: “Either ye bring<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Right soon your father here before me, else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spurn you from my seat. What! think ye I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am here to answer riddles? Or do ye wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the true Ring find a tongue and speak?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet stay! ’Tis said that in the true Ring lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A magic gift, to make the owner loved&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-pleasing before God and man. So good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This shall decide the cause; for never, surely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this the false can emulate the true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of the three of ye is best beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the other twain? Marry, speak out! Ye are dumb!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious power, that only backward works,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not outward from within! Lo, each of you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loves best of all&mdash;himself! So are ye all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceived, and all deceivers. All your rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are manifestly false. Belike the true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was irrecoverably lost; and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your father, to conceal the loss, made three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In place of one.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“And so,” the Judge continued, “if ye now<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Are bent on Law, on that alone, and counsel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as I can, will none&mdash;I bid you hence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if I counselled you, my rede were this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take ye the matter simply as it lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each from your father had his ring&mdash;let each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be well persuaded that the ring he holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the true Ring. It may be that your father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was minded to maintain the tyranny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the one Ring no longer. And ’tis certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved you all, and loved you each alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would not have one exalted, one oppressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark that! and be it yours to emulate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His great impartial love. Strive, each of you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show the Ring’s benignant might his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, help the mystic power to do its kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentleness, with loving courtesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneficence to man, and unto God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep devotion of the inmost soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, full many a generation hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within your children’s children’s children’s hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of the Ring is manifest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! in a thousand thousand years, again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before this judgment-seat I summon you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where one more wise than I shall sit and speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now go your ways.” So spake the modest Judge.<br /></span>
